// ~~ NOTE üé§üé§ ~~\\

//  adviceId and advice are variables that store references to HTML elements with the IDs advice_id and advice, respectively. These elements will display the advice ID and the advice text fetched from the API.

// link stores the URL of the API endpoint. This particular API provides random advice in JSON format. When a request is made to this URL, it returns a random piece of advice.

// getAdvice is an asynchronous function, indicated by the async keyword. Asynchronous functions allow for non-blocking code execution, meaning the function can wait for operations like fetching data from an API without stopping other code from running.

// The fetch function sends a request to the API endpoint specified in link. The await keyword pauses the function until the request is completed and a response is received.

// The response.json() method parses the response data as JSON. This method also returns a promise, so await is used to wait for the parsing to complete. The parsed JSON data is stored in the data variable.
